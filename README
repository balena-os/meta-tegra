OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for NVIDIA Tegra X1/X2/K1/Xavier
=============================================================


*** PLEASE NOTE ***

 This branch is a work in progress. Things are likely to be broken,
 or may change or disappear over time. The L4T/JetPack contents are
 from a "Developer Preview" from NVIDIA, and will be short-lived.
 Feel free to experiment, but please do not base any production
 development on it.

*******************

Boards supported:
* Jetson Xavier development kit (Linux4Tegra R31.0.2, Jetpack 4.1 DP)

Also appears to be working, somewhat:
* Jetson-TX2 development kit (Linux4Tegra R31.0.2, Jetpack 4.1 DP)

May currently be broken:
* Jetson-TK1 development kit (Linux4Tegra R21.7)
* Jetson-TX1 development kit (Linux4Tegra R28.2, JetPack 3.3)

This layer depends on:
URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: thud

TO DO
-----

* The nveglglessink gstreamer plugin isn't working with wayland
  when built from sources, even after updating the recipe to compile
  in wayland support.
* The binary-only gstreamer plugins provided by NVIDIA are built for
  gstreamer 1.14. Will need to migrate this branch to be based off
  master/thud instead, since OE-Core thud has gstreamer 1.14.
